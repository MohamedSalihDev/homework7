 ## Description

>Have you ever needed to check social media really quickly but were worried that doing so will show posts that spoil something you wanted to watch later? This app is a browser that aims to prevent spoilers of your favorite TV shows, movies, and sports by hiding any content that appears which is related to what you would like to watch later. The app will list the keywords that caused the post to be hidden without revealing its contents. You can manually unhide the content by pressing unhide.
