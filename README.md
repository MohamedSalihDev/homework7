 ## Description

>This is a CLI app that generates a readme.md file for your project. It uses the node inquirer package to present a set of questions in the command line that guide the user in generating the readme. It takes the answers and plugs them into a neatly formatted readme.md template. The readme2.md file is designed to display the results of the readme generator and is not intended to describe a real app.

 ## Instructions

>Clone the repository from GitHub. Run node index.js. 

## Usage

>Answer the questions completely and accurately in the command line. Your readme.md will be automatically generated as readme2.md.

## Contribution

>I worked on this as an academic school assigment. I used the curriculum of Trilogy Education as a guide in putting this together.

## Test

>Follow the directions above in Instructions and Usage.
